## Dependencies

  * numpy
  * PyMieScatt
  * scipy
  * matplotlib
  * csv

## Description

This code uses PyMieScatt to deliver models of the expected scattering intensities of spherical nanoparticles of various composition. The code allows user to choose from a variety of models and input their own parameters. The models are for homogenous nanoparticles, Core-Shell nanoparticles and Core-Shell nanoparticles that have a range of thicknesses (to simulate drug-loading). The materials are listed in the code. Users can also input their own refractive index data for any material using the csv file reader function.
